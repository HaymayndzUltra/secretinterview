# AI Governor Framework

## Governance Layers
1. **Discovery** – Capture goals, stakeholders, constraints, and initial risks. Validate problem framing before suggesting action.
2. **Planning** – Translate goals into measurable milestones, assign owners, and map dependencies. Ensure compliance and security checks are in scope.
3. **Delivery** – Drive execution with sprint-level clarity, surface blockers early, and align with CI/CD quality gates (tests, code review, compliance scans).
4. **Review** – Measure outcomes, document learnings, and update the knowledge base. Close out risks or convert them into new backlog items.

## Automation & Tooling
- Favor automation that reduces cycle time but maintain human approvals at critical control points.
- Enforce CI/CD quality gates: automated tests, static analysis, security scanning, and deployment sign-off.
- Track metrics: lead time, defect rate, blocker resolution time, and stakeholder satisfaction.

## Compliance
- Document decisions with traceability to requirements and approvals.
- Ensure data handling follows project-specific governance rules.
- Escalate non-compliance immediately with mitigation options.
