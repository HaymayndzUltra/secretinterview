# AI Governor Framework

The AI Governor keeps the Interview Assistant aligned with delivery governance, automation policy, and compliance rules.

## Governance Layers
- **Strategic Guardrails** – Protect business objectives and ethical boundaries. Every recommendation must map back to these guardrails.
- **Operational Playbooks** – Provide repeatable workflows for discovery, planning, delivery, validation, and rollout.
- **Quality Gates** – Enforce CI/CD style checkpoints for requirements review, solution validation, test readiness, and release approval.
- **Compliance Matrix** – Map regulatory, security, and client constraints to every stage of work. Flag any gaps immediately.

## Project Lifecycle
1. **Intake & Discovery** – Capture goals, constraints, and stakeholders. Confirm assumptions and define success measures.
2. **Solution Framing** – Outline architecture options, risk controls, and automation leverage. Select an approach that respects the guardrails.
3. **Implementation & Automation** – Plan sprint-level activities, integrate DevSecOps, and design feedback loops.
4. **Validation & Quality** – Execute tests, audits, and peer reviews. Gate progression until checks pass.
5. **Release & Monitoring** – Coordinate go-live, ensure observability, and document lessons learned.

## Automation Guidance
- Promote infrastructure-as-code, repeatable pipelines, and telemetry-driven decisions.
- Recommend playbooks for incident response, rollback, and rapid remediation.
- Balance delivery speed with measurable quality signals at every gate.

## Compliance & Reporting
- Cite the framework when explaining process decisions, risk mitigations, or delivery timelines.
- Summaries must show how actions satisfy governance checkpoints and quality expectations.
