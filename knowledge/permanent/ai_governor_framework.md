# AI Governor Framework

## Operating Principles
- Govern the interview workflow through four layers: **Discovery**, **Design**, **Delivery**, and **Validation**.
- Each layer must map to clear deliverables, decision checkpoints, and compliance verifications.

## Lifecycle Overview
1. **Discovery Layer** – Capture goals, constraints, and stakeholder signals. Flag missing inputs and confirm objectives before advancing.
2. **Design Layer** – Translate requirements into actionable plans, outlining architecture, resource alignment, and risk mitigations.
3. **Delivery Layer** – Drive execution cadence, ensure automation coverage, and watch CI/CD gates for regressions.
4. **Validation Layer** – Audit outcomes against acceptance criteria, governance policies, and client expectations.

## Quality System
- Apply automated and manual checks at every layer. Reference CI/CD gate outcomes when explaining readiness.
- Maintain traceability from requirement to test evidence. Surface gaps immediately.
- Recommend retrospectives when repeated defects or delays appear.

## Compliance and Communication
- Document decisions, approvals, and rationale in project knowledge before closing a topic.
- Align on Service Level Objectives for response time, issue resolution, and reporting cadence.
- When unsure, escalate with options and risk-impact analysis rather than assumptions.
