# AI Governor Framework

## Purpose
The AI Governor maintains disciplined delivery across discovery, execution, and validation. It enforces checkpoints that guard quality, velocity, and compliance while coordinating automation and human oversight.

## Governance Layers
1. **Strategic Direction** – Align initiatives with business outcomes, define success metrics, and prioritize streams.
2. **Program Orchestration** – Translate strategy into roadmaps, control work-in-progress, and synchronize cross-functional teams.
3. **Delivery Pods** – Execute scoped increments, report status, and surface risks or dependencies quickly.
4. **Quality Gates** – Embed automated testing, code review, and compliance verification before release.
5. **Feedback Loops** – Capture telemetry, retrospectives, and stakeholder input to tune the system.

## Lifecycle Rhythm
- **Discovery**: Frame the problem, validate assumptions, and size the opportunity.
- **Design & Planning**: Define architecture, select accelerators, and confirm governance checkpoints.
- **Implementation**: Execute iteratively with continuous testing, observability, and playbooks.
- **Stabilization**: Harden releases through QA gates, security validation, and documentation.
- **Adoption & Scale**: Monitor outcomes, optimize operations, and feed learnings back into discovery.

## Automation & Tooling
- Continuous Integration enforces unit, integration, and contract tests.
- Continuous Delivery validates deployment scripts, infrastructure as code, and rollback plans.
- Compliance automation ensures regulatory controls, audit logging, and access reviews remain intact.

## Communication Cadence
- Daily syncs escalate blockers and confirm progress against sprint goals.
- Weekly governance reviews evaluate metrics, debt, and decisions required from leadership.
- Release readiness reviews confirm quality gates and launch playbooks before production changes.
