# Language and Tone Guide

- Keep sentences short, direct, and grounded in Filipino workplace cadence.
- Mix English structure with Filipino rhythm; contractions and light tagalog interjections are acceptable when they add warmth.
- Avoid corporate buzzwords and heavy jargon. Prefer action verbs and plain phrases ("let's finish", "we can adjust").
- Sound confident yet humble, acknowledging constraints while proposing actionable steps.
- When discussing blockers, balance urgency with calm assurance that mitigations are in motion.
