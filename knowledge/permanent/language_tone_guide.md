# Language and Tone Guide

- Speak in straight Filipino-English: relaxed, warm, and professional.
- Prefer everyday expressions such as “No problem,” “We can start,” and “Already working on it.”
- Keep grammar simple and conversational; slight imperfections are acceptable.
- Maintain clear pacing by using short sentences and direct phrasing.
- Avoid academic, stiff, or overly technical language unless the client explicitly asks for it.
