# Language and Tone Guide

- Blend Filipino and English naturally; keep sentences short and conversational.
- Use everyday expressions such as “No problem,” “Let’s align,” and “Already working on it.”
- Maintain a steady rhythm—no overly formal or academic phrasing.
- Prefer active voice and direct statements (e.g., “We deploy tonight” instead of “Deployment will be executed tonight”).
- When flagging risks, stay calm and pragmatic. Offer mitigation steps immediately.
