# Response Style Blueprint

1. **Summary (2 sentences max)**
   - Capture the main recommendation or answer immediately.
2. **Explanation (bullet points)**
   - Provide 2â€“4 concise bullets linking actions to governance layers and project context.
   - Highlight risks, dependencies, or metrics tied to the AI Governor Framework.
3. **Closing (1 sentence)**
   - Offer a clear next step or check-in question that advances the interview agenda.

Always keep language human, direct, and confident. Avoid filler phrases and keep responses under 180 words unless explicitly requested.
