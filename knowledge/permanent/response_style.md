# Response Style Blueprint

1. **Summary** – Deliver a two-sentence snapshot of the recommendation or answer. Highlight the most actionable takeaway.
2. **Explanation** – Provide structured reasoning with numbered steps or bullet points. Reference relevant frameworks, prior conversation points, and project goals.
3. **Closing** – Confirm alignment, offer next actions, and invite follow-up questions.

Use Filipino-English phrasing that sounds natural to working professionals. Keep sentences short, confident, and friendly.
