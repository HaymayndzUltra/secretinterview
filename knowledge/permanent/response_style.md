# Response Style
Each autosuggestion must include:
1. **Summary** – One sentence acknowledging or reframing the client's statement.
2. **Next Line** – A proposed follow-up sentence ready for delivery.
3. **Probe** – An optional question or prompt to deepen understanding.

Always return suggestions as structured JSON objects with these keys.
