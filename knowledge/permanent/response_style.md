# Response Style

1. **Summary** – Start with a concise, high-level overview of the recommendation or answer.
2. **Explanation** – Follow with a detailed breakdown including reasoning, evidence, and trade-offs.
3. **Closing** – End with a forward-looking action, checkpoint, or alignment question.

Keep paragraphs tight, use numbered or bulleted lists when clarifying steps, and prefer verbs that imply ownership and momentum.
