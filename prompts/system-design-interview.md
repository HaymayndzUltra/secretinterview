## Follow-up Questions

- "How would you handle a 10x increase in traffic?"
- "What are the potential failure points in this design?"
- "How would you monitor the health of this system?"
- "What would you do differently if you had more time?"
- "How would you test this system at scale?"

## Red Flags to Watch For

- Inability to break down complex problems
- Lack of consideration for scalability
- Poor understanding of distributed systems
- Inability to explain design decisions
- Doesn't ask clarifying questions

## Closing Notes

Focus on the candidate's ability to think systematically about complex problems. The goal is to assess their architectural thinking, technical knowledge, and problem-solving approach rather than expecting perfect solutions.
