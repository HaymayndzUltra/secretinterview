## ðŸš€ Next Steps for Testing

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd template-packs/frontend/expo/base
npm install
```

### 2. Run Automated Tests
```bash
npm run test-upgrade
```

### 3. Test Development Server
```bash
# Test native development
npx expo start

# Test web development
npx expo start --web

# Test with tunnel
npx expo start --tunnel
```

### 4. Test Native Builds
```bash
# Test iOS build
npx expo run:ios

# Test Android build
npx expo run:android

# Test prebuild
npx expo prebuild
```

### 5. Test EAS Builds
```bash
# Test development builds
eas build --profile development --platform ios
eas build --profile development --platform android

# Test preview builds
eas build --profile preview --platform ios
eas build --profile preview --platform android

# Test production builds
eas build --profile production --platform ios
eas build --profile production --platform android
```

## ðŸ“‹ Expected Results

### âœ… Development Server
- `expo start` should work without errors
- Native and web platforms should load successfully
- No redbox errors should appear

### âœ… Native Builds
- `expo run:ios` should build and run on iOS simulator
- `expo run:android` should build and run on Android emulator
- Navigation should work correctly (deep links, stack navigation)

### âœ… Reanimated v4 + Worklets
- Animations should work without babel/plugin errors
- Worklets should execute properly
- No Metro bundler errors related to worklets

### âœ… EAS Builds
- Development builds should succeed for both platforms
- Preview builds should succeed for both platforms
- Production builds should succeed for both platforms

### âœ… New Architecture
- New Architecture should be enabled in native builds
- No legacy architecture warnings should appear
- Performance improvements should be noticeable

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Metro bundler issues**
   ```bash
   npx expo start -c  # Clear cache
   npx expo install --fix
   ```

2. **TypeScript compilation errors**
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit  # Check for type errors
   ```

3. **Reanimated v4 issues**
   - Ensure `react-native-worklets/plugin` is in babel.config.js
   - Check that worklets are properly imported
   - Verify Metro configuration includes worklets support

4. **New Architecture issues**
   - Check that `newArchEnabled: true` is set in app.json
   - Verify expo-build-properties plugin is configured
   - Check third-party library compatibility

5. **React Navigation v7 issues**
   - Update navigation imports to v7 syntax
   - Check for deprecated props
   - Update navigation types

## ðŸ“Š Performance Expectations

With SDK 54 and New Architecture:
- **Faster app startup times** (20-30% improvement)
- **Improved animation performance** (Reanimated v4 + worklets)
- **Better memory management** (New Architecture)
- **Enhanced developer experience** (React 19 features)

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics

The upgrade is considered successful when:
1. âœ… All acceptance criteria are met
2. âœ… `expo start` works (native + web)
3. âœ… `expo run:ios` and `expo run:android` build successfully
4. âœ… Navigation works (deep links, app boots without redboxes)
5. âœ… Reanimated v4 + worklets installed with no babel/plugin errors
6. âœ… EAS build succeeds for both platforms
7. âœ… New Architecture is enabled and working
